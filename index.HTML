    <h2>Marching band and the Director</h2>
      <p>Marching Band is such a fun sport. We have a lot of fun playing music and
        listening to our show music and finding out what our show is going to be
        for that season. Band is A LOT of hard work but it's worth it in the end.
        We have amazing band directors. Meg Beavers is our main director. She's
        very funny, kind of everyone, and makes every season a great one. Doug Perry
        and Pam Waits are the couches for the Color Guard. Both of them are very witty
        and help the guard to be the best that they can. Mr. Perry is so amazing
        at coming up with work for our show. He also helps Ms.Beavers with the band
        sometimes. Shane Matthews is the director for the percussion/battery. Mr.
        Matthews is caring and he helps Ms.Beavers with the whole band too. Our
        band directors make a great team to make our band the best and making
        each season one to remember.</p>

    <h2>Color Guard</h2>
      <p2>I love doing Color Guard for the Licking Heights High School.
      It's such an amazing experience. I love getting to meet new people every year.
      Being in guard is so amazing. The costumes the guard wears are really unique
      and go great with our shows theme. The flags we use for our show are so beautiful.
      Guard is the best section of the band. We get everyone excited for football
      games and we get along with everyone in the band. Even though is looks hard,
      its actually not. Once you get the hang of it, you'll look like a pro. I love
      the group of people I'm with. I wouldn't trade it for anything. This is going
      to be my third year in guard and I can't wait to see how this year will turn
      out. We're a huge family and we enjoy being around each other.</p2>

    <h2>What we do in Band</h2>
      <p3>Towards the end of July and early August we have band camp.
      It's from 8am-4pm everyday for two weeks. We have Saturday and Sunday off.
      During band camp we learn our show that we will perform. We have practice
      Monday-Friday 3-5:15 after school. It's a lot of hard
      work but it's worth it. Friday nights we have football games and they are
      the best. We all have a blast playing music,
      acting crazy, and watching the football players win. At half-time we perform our
      show for the school. Then on Saturdays we have competitions. Sometimes we
      have two competitions in a day. Winning a
      competition is so much fun. The whole band gets excited when the judges
      annouce that we're going to state finals. Band is such a great experience
      and you'll have so much fun.</p3>
