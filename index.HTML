    <h2 style="color: maroon;">Marching Band and the Director</h2>
      <p style="color: black;">Marching Band is such a fun sport. We have a lot of fun playing music and
        listening to our show music and finding out what our show is going to be
        for that season. Band is A LOT of hard work but it's worth it in the end.
        We have amazing band directors. Meg Beavers is our main director. She's
        very funny, kind, and makes every season a great one. Doug Perry
        and Pam Waits are the couches for the Color Guard. Both of them are very witty
        and help the guard to be the best that they can be. Mr. Perry is so amazing
        at coming up with work for our show. Shane Mathews is the director for the percussion/battery. Mr.Mathews is funny and he helps Ms.Beavers with the band too. 
		Our band directors make a great team to make our band is the best and making
        each season one to remember.</p>

    <h2 style="color: maroon;">Color Guard</h2>
      <p2 style="color: black;">I love doing Color Guard for the Licking Heights High School.
      It's such an amazing experience. I love getting to meet new people every year.
      Being in guard is so amazing. The costumes the guard wears are really unique
      and go great with our shows theme. The flags we use for our show are so beautiful.
      Guard is the best section of the band. We get everyone excited for football
      games and we get along with everyone in the band. Even though is looks hard,
      its actually not. Once you get the hang of it, you'll look like a pro. I love
      the group of people I'm with. I wouldn't trade it for anything. This is going
      to be my third year in guard and I can't wait to see how this year will turn
      out. We're a huge family and we enjoy being around each other.</p2>

    <h2 style="color: maroon;">What we do in Band</h2>
      <p3 style="color: black;">Towards the end of July and early August we have
      band camp.It's from 8am-4pm everyday for two weeks. We have Saturday and Sunday off.
      During band camp we learn our show that we will perform. We have practice
      Monday-Friday 3-5:15 after school. It's a lot of hard
      work but it's worth it. Friday nights we have football games and they are
      the best. We all have a blast playing music,
      acting crazy, and watching the football players win. At half-time we perform our
      show for the school. Then on Saturdays we have competitions. Sometimes we
      have two competitions in a day. Winning a
      competition is so much fun. The whole band gets excited when the judges
      annouce that we're going to state finals. Band is such a great experience
      and you'll have so much fun.</p3>

   <h2 style="color: maroon;">Our Band Parents</h2>
    <p4 style="color: black;"> Our band has amazing band parents. They support
      everyone of us. Our parents always make sure that we have water when we
      have parades, make sure all of our instruments and equipment are loaded to
      go for every football game and competition. Our parents also help with the
      music boosters. They all give a helping hand to raise money so the band can
      get new uniforms, new music, new props for the show, and so much more. Our
      parents want to see everyone happy, healthy, and most of all they make sure
      that we have food. Band kids love food so, the parents always make sure that
      all the band students are fed and ready to go. We love all of our band parents
      and we appreciate them all for their hard work and their support of this band.
